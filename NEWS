Testing Results:     (Thanks to all who have responded, keep up the great work!)

    Mice that are reported working (XF86-Mouse gpm-type):
        Intellimouse PS/2 (IMPS/2 or imps2/MouseSystems)
        - including Intellieye mice, except any thumb buttons on the Pro version
		  for that you need X support for buttons 5 and 6 or jam...
        Intellimouse Serial (Intellimouse ms3)
        Logitech PS/2 (MouseManPlusPS/2 mm+ps2) Serial (MouseManPlus mman)
        - Trackman Marble FX (gpm -t tmmfx w/Method#2)
            serial mouse driver, works like in windows.
        - Marble FX (gpm -t marblefx w/Method#2)
            new driver in gpm may give FULL functionality using Method #2
            this works like in windows, click on/off for wheel functions
			other setups may only leave you with the Up dir, see also imwheel -4
        - Marble +
        - Pilot Mouse+
        - Cordless Wheel Mouse (Method #1 @least)
        - Mouseman Wheel (Method #1 @least)
        - Cordless Wheel Mouse PS/2 (gpm -t mm+ps2 w/Method#2)
        - Firstmouse
        - Logitech M-BA47 (imps2 for non OEM-color label on mouse)
        Genius PS/2
        - NetMouse Pro PS/2
        - NewScroll/PS2 (1:IMPS/2 or 2:imps2/MouseSystems)
        - Trust Ami Mouse Scroll Pro Excellence series
        - WinEasy 4D
        - Primax CyberNavigator [1] mouse
        - Ami Mouse Scroll Pro (Excellence Series)
            says Jay at predator1710@gmx.net
        - Arowana PS/2 WheelMouse
            says frank.van.geirt@pandora.be
		- Dexxa Optical Pro (PS/2)
			uses imps/2 type drivers

    Mice I support due to having them:
        Intellimouse PS/2
        IBM ScrollPoint PS/2

    Works Great With:
        Netscape (3.04, 4.0x, 4.5) (click to change wheel focus)
        - All Netscape clients: Mail, Composer, etc...
        - click to focus on frames. (Forms work now like they should!)
        XLess
        GVim (Lesstif)
        XiTerm
        ETerm
        NXTerm
        rxvt
		- rxvt/src/feature.h has several scroll-related options
		- you may want to compile rxvt without scroll wheel support
        Acroread 3.1 and up
        xterm (including scrolling the xterm itself!)
        - scrolling XTerm (instead of typing in it) is possible when the config
          file is set up.  The included imwheelrc has a setting that uses alt
          for scrolling the actual scrollbar on the xterm!
        - shift up and down work in bash!
        - if using vim or less, the plain/shifted/controled wheel works as
          expected!
        MGV
        ghostview
        some lesstif/motif windows, like file selectors... (click to focus!)
        KDE stuff (what? well...anything that has key responses!)
        XMan (requires an .imwheelrc configuration as included in archive)
        Staroffice 4.0 and up
        XV (window grab...may need help, read on)
        - Needs configuration, see @Exclude command notes in README, unless...
        - if used with wheel fifos in gpm and imwheel, it's fine!
        emacs (see EMACS file for some help if you want it!)
        KDE (kfm, kmail, etc...)

        Any client that accepts keyboard control should be configurable,
          if not, work without configuration but with the built-in defaults!

    Not Working At All:
        XFree86 4.0 support for /dev/gpmdata or /dev/jam_*:* FIFO mouse devices
        - use the ZAxis method, and if your mouse doesn't work...try again.
          or fallback to the 3.2+ server distros - argh.
        Clients that don't expect any keys at all.
        - There is no way to do this, except maybe X server ICC...but I don't
          know any of that stuff, I only know about it, and it's C code calls.
        Console
        - I'm looking into this, now that I tangled with gpm for wheel info!
        QTronix (?) mouse - which one???  we need the init code apparently.

    May work, But it depends on which Method and which client:
        Wheel buttons in KDE clients when using wheel-fifo.
        - I mean KDE client that use actual wheel mouse stuff, won't...
          since the wheel is not going through the XServer at all!
          unless they expect pageup/pagedown too...
          in method #1 you can exclude these windows and they should work!

    XServers that may work if used with the included gpm and imwheel wheel fifo:
        XInside's Accelerated-X (There is no wheel support in AccelX!)
        - you must use the included gpm and imwheel with the wheel fifo options!

    XServers that are thought so far to be useless with a wheel mouse:
        Any win32 XServer software that has no XTest extension.
        - XVision has support I think, I'll test it at work, if I ever boot into
          NT again.  I haven't run NT in 5 weeks now, and I don't intend to!
