# If this is activated it will only apps that have a lower priority
# priority is based first on the priority command, then the position in this
# file - the higher the line is in a file the higher in a priority class it is
# thus for a default priority you can see that the position in the file is
# important, but the priority command CAN appear anywahere in a window's list
# of translations, and the priority will be assigned to all translations below
# it until either a new window is defined or the priority is set again.
