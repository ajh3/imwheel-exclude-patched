                        KNOWN BUGS for current version.
Please only report with new bugs, patches or suggestions, not these bugs!

Really weird things can happen...like keys still acting like they're pressed.
- If the focus is changed while wheeling actions are going on...hoo boy.
- If the modifier(s) are let up while wheeling actions are going on...hoo boy.
- To reset virtually stuck keys press and release all of them once, that works!

Non-wheel-fifo users that have things like the following in the imwheelrc:
	Shift_L, Up, Button4
- will find that to send the Button4, imwheel must ungrab the mouse buttons
  meaning that REAL mouse button events have a chance to slip through.
  this results in unknown behaviour.
- the best solution is to find keys that do the same function, and use them
  in your imwheelrc, instead of sending ButtonN events.

Memory footprint too big, says one person...
- Mine runs at about 1620 bytes well what am I gonna do!

@Exclude not excluding (at least since 0.9), may still not work in 0.9.7
- Method#1 users who use xv need this...
- could someone else please play with this.  XWheel won't care about this
  problem as it is now, because it will be more integrated into the low level.

Configuration dialog doesn't grab wheel actions for Method#1
- Oops...it's not that useful anyways.

          OLD FIXED BUGS!  It's always nice to see what's been fixed!

See Changes file for bug updates...keeping track in two places sucked eggs!
